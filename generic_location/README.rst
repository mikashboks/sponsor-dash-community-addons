Generic Location is a module developed by the `Center of Research &
Development company <https://crnd.pro/>`__.

It allows you to make an abstract description of the objects location
relative to the general location (for example: house3 ▶️ office5 ▶️
room2 ▶️ table5).

Each sub-location may have many own sub-locations, so that you can
easily describe complex objects using a tree-like structure.

The module is designed for use with other Odoo applications and modules
and can extend its functionality depending on the installed modules.

**Location access feature:** if you grant access for the user to some location, this user will automatically have access to all of its sub-locations.

Main Features of the Generic Location Module:
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  *Create and customize an abstract location model of your business
   objects.*
-  *Link your resources, services, etc. to crated locations.*
-  *Keep an eye on your resources, services etc. for more convenient
   work.*
